This project demonstrates a **basic DevOps pipeline** implemented in Python.

## 🔹 What this pipeline does
- Clone a Git repository
- Install dependencies
- Run tests
- Build the project
- Simulate deployment

## 🔹 Why this project?
This project is designed for **beginners** to understand:
- CI/CD concepts
- Automation using scripts
- DevOps workflow without complex tools

## 🔹 Technologies used
- Python
- Git
- Basic CI/CD logic

## 🔹 How to run
```bash
python pipeline.py

# 🔐 DevSecOps Pipeline (Security Integrated)

This project extends the DevOps pipeline by **integrating security checks**.

## 🔹 Added security steps
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Secure pipeline execution

## 🔹 Why DevSecOps?
DevSecOps ensures that **security is integrated from the beginning**, not added later.

## 🔹 Difference from DevOps
| DevOps | DevSecOps |
|------|----------|
Automation | Automation + Security |
Fast delivery | Secure & fast delivery |
Security at the end | Security at every stage |

## 🔹 Goal
Demonstrate the **shift-left security approach**.

📌 This project is educational and beginner-friendly.
